# PasswordManager
This is a work in progress for a Python based password manager. The plan is 
for this to be a fully functional application in which somebody could actually 
store their login information. The program will also allow for users to request 
randomly generated passwords. The biggest struggle at the moment is trying to 
create a GUI. For the time being, I will be focusing on the core aspects of the 
program and turn to the GUI at the end. I am open to working with other programmers 
on this if anybody is familiar with making python GUIs.
